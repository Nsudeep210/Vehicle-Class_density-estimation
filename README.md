Vehicle tracking is the process of locating a moving
vehicle using a camera. Capturing vehicles in video
sequences from surveillance cameras is a demanding
application to improve tracking performance. This
technology is increasing the number of applications such
as traffic control, traffic monitoring, traffic flow, security,
etc. The estimated cost of using this technology will be
very less. Video and image processing has been used for
traffic surveillance, analysis, and monitoring of traffic
conditions in many cities and urban areas. If we could
integrate a vehicle detection system in a traffic light
camera, one could easily track a number of useful things
simultaneously: -

1.How many vehicles are present at the traffic junction
during the day?
2.What time does the traffic build up?
3.What kind of vehicles are traversing the junction
(heavy vehicles, cars,
4.Is there a way to optimize the traffic and distribute it
through a different street? And so on.

2.What time does the traffic build up?
3.What kind of vehicles are traversing the junction
(heavy vehicles, cars, two wheelers, etc.)?
4.Is there a way to optimize the traffic and distribute it
through a different street? And so on.
